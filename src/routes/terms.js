      <p className="p3 ft3">Change My World Now ("CMWN") is provided by
      Gina's Ink, Incorporated. CMWN is dedicated to protecting the privacy of
      children and handling any personal information we obtain from our users with care
      and respect. This document describes our commitment to privacy and the things that
      we are doing to keep kids' information safe and secure. As described in more
      detail below, <span className="ft2">CMWN does not sell, rent or trade personal

      </p>

      <p className="p5 ft6">What are the rules for accessing CMWN?</p>

      <p className="p6 ft7">In order to meet legal requirements and help protect the
      privacy and safety of kids, we have some rules that apply. Use of CMWN is
      restricted to teachers, parents/guardians, and students of schools who have
      contracted with us to further the educational experience and enrich the curriculum
      for the students of that particular school or school district.</p>

      <p className="p7 ft3">If you are a student, there are some rules that apply to
      you:</p>

      <p className="p8 ft7"><span className="ft8">{BULLET}</span><span className="ft9">You
      will only be able to register for and access CMWN if your school has agreed with
      CMWN to provide access to you. If you are under 13, your parent or guardian must
      provide verifiable parental consent ("Consent") to your
      school.</span></p>

      <p className="p9 ft7"><span className="ft8">{BULLET}</span><span className="ft9">You
      will only access CMWN using the</span> log-in and password information given to you
      by your school. You may not use any log-in information which you receive from other
      students or which you did not receive directly from your school. You should keep
      your log-in information safe and not share it with others, including other
      students.</p>

      <p className="p10 ft3">If you are a school, the following rules also apply:</p>

      <p className="p11 ft7">
          <span className="ft8">{BULLET}</span><span className="ft9">You represent and acknowledge that you
          are solely responsible for complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection
          Act ("COPPA"), where applicable. For more information on COPPA and kid's privacy

      <p className="p12 ft7"><span className="ft8">{BULLET}</span><span className=
      "ft9">Where applicable, you must obtain Consent from all parents or guardians whose
      children under the age of 13 will be accessing CMWN and provide a copy to us upon
      our request.</span></p>

      <p className="p13 ft5"><span className="ft8">{BULLET}</span><span className=
      "ft11">When obtaining Consent, you must provide parents or guardians with the
      disclosures required under COPPA, including a copy of our Privacy Policy and
      Conditions of Use.</span></p>

      <p className="p14 ft3"><span className="ft8">{BULLET}</span><span className=
      "ft12">You are solely responsible for the activities of your registered users on
      CMWN. You will only grant access to current students, parents/guardians, and
      teachers and staff members, and will immediately revoke digital access and require
      return of all</span> log-in information for any individuals no longer enrolled,
      employed, or parents/guardians of students not enrolled at your school. If at
      any time you learn a user of CMWN claims to be affiliated with
    your school or district who is not, in fact, affiliated with your school or district,
    you will notify CMWN immediately.</p>

    <p className="p10 ft3">If you are using CMWN as a Teacher, the following rules also
    apply:</p>

    <p className="p17 ft5"><span className="ft8">{BULLET}</span><span className="ft11">You
    represent and warrant that you have permission from your school to use CMWN as part
    of your curriculum.</span></p>

    <p className="p18 ft7"><span className="ft8">{BULLET}</span><span className="ft9">You
    understand that the school is responsible for complying with COPPA, where applicable,
    which requires Consent for online collection of personal information from children
    under 13. For more information on COPPA, please see </span>

        </a>
    </p>

    <p className="p7 ft3">If you are using CMWN as a Parent or Guardian, the following
    rules also apply:</p>

    <p className="p19 ft3"><span className="ft8">{BULLET}</span><span className="ft12">You
    will only use the</span> log-in information provided to you by your child's
    school.</p>

    <p className="p20 ft3"><span className="ft8">{BULLET}</span><span className="ft12">You
    understand that your acceptance of this Privacy Policy indicates that you are
    agreeing to the Privacy Policy both on your own behalf as well as on behalf of your
    child or children who use CMWN, and that, if you have a child under the age of 13,
    that child may not use CMWN until you have provided Consent to your child's
    school. Although the process may vary, many schools will request that you sign a
    consent form at the beginning of each school year.</span></p>

    <p className="p21 ft1">What types of personal information do we collect?</p>

    <p className="p22 ft5"><span className="ft8">{BULLET}</span><span className=
    "ft14">Information Collection Without Registration</span>. We do not collect personal
    information from kids unless they are registered for CMWN by their school.</p>

    <p className="p14 ft3"><span className="ft8">{BULLET}</span><span className=
    "ft15">Information from Kids Collected in Registration</span>. When schools register
    their students for CMWN, we obtain certain personal information related to each
    student, including the child's first and last name, email address (this is
    optional), date of birth, gender, grade level, classes, and school/district. We
    collect birth dates to validate the ages of our guests, including students. We
    collect first and last name since we discourage students from using their last names
    on their profile pages and/or as part of their user name. By collecting a
    student's last name, we can safeguard against unnecessary disclosure of
    personal information on our website.</p>

    <p className="p23 ft3"><span className="ft8">{BULLET}</span><span className=
    "ft15">Information Collected While Logged On</span>. Students are given the
    opportunity to create profile pages on our website and to participate in creative and
    educational activities. In their profiles, kids can make notes about activities they
    are working on and can see notes posted by other kids that relate to the same
    activity. Kids can upload materials that relate to the activities they are working on
    such as a poem, a short video or picture of themselves, a picture of a painting, etc.
    In order to protect the privacy and security of students online, we review all
    information posted and/or uploaded by students before publishing it on the website.
    If we discover information that in our sole opinion is not appropriate or may be
    misconstrued or expose the child or others to any risk, it will not be published and
    the school may be notified.</p>

    <p className="p24 ft3"><span className="ft8">{BULLET}</span><span className=
    "ft15">Information Collected from Parents or Guardians</span>. We also collect
    certain information from the school about parents/guardians as part of the
    registration process, including first and last name, address, phone number, and email
    address. Through the registration process, we will create an inactive profile for
    parents or guardians of children registered for CMWN and the parent or</p>

    <p className="p27 ft3">guardian will receive an email inviting them to set-up their
    profile. We encourage parents or guardians to explore CMWN and to create their own
    profile pages and they may share personal information as they do so. Note, however,
    that in order to help promote and maintain a safe online environment for children,
    parents or guardians who are under the age of 18 are not registered for CMWN and
    cannot interact with children on CMWN.</p>

    <p className="p28 ft3"><span className="ft8">{BULLET}</span><span className=
    "ft15">Cookie Policy</span>. Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts
    may be used by CMWN and our partners who provide online customer support, storage,
    and video management. These technologies are used to make it easier for students and
    teachers to navigate our site, analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking
    users' movements throughout the site and to gather demographic information
    about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these
    technologies by our partners on an aggregated basis<span className="ft2">.</span></p>

    <p className="p29 ft7">We may also use various types of Local Storage, including (but
    not limited to) Local Storage Objects (LSOs), Local Session Storage Objects, Browser
    Caching, Browser Cookies and local storage mechanisms implemented by Flash to store
    content information and preferences.</p>

    <p className="p30 ft7">You may be able to manage or block these technologies through
    your website browser, although CMWN does not control and cannot guarantee the
    effectiveness of such tools. In addition, blocking or deleting cookies may limit
    users' ability to use and enjoy CMWN.</p>

    </p>

    <p className="p32 ft7"><span className="ft18">Do Not Track Disclosure</span>. Do Not
    Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in some web browsers, allowing
    users to opt out of tracking by websites and online services. At the present time,
    the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has not yet established universal standards for
    recognizable DNT signals and therefore, CMWN does not recognize DNT.</p>

    <p className="p5 ft1">How do we use and share the personally identifiable information
    that we have collected about kids?</p>

    <p className="p33 ft19">CMWN does not share, sell, rent or trade children's
    personal information with third parties other than as disclosed within this privacy
    policy or after notice and obtaining written consent from a school.</p>

    <p className="p34 ft2">We do not use personal information from children for
    advertising purposes and do not allow any third-parties to do so. <span className=
    "ft3">We may use information from parents or guardians to communicate with them
    from</span> <span className="ft3">time-to-time</span> <span className="ft3">about
    CMWN and other products or services we may provide. We utilize certain</span>
    <span className="ft3">third-party</span> <span className="ft3">partners to help us
    deliver the services and understand certain activities, so that we can improve the
    quality of our service. An example would be services that allow us to analyze our
    usage data. These services would be required to access</span> <span className=
    "ft3">non-personal</span> <span className="ft3">information, solely for the purpose
    of improving service. We and our partners may also combine and analyze information
    that we collect and share</span> <span className="ft3">non-personal</span>
    <span className="ft3">or</span> <span className="ft3">de-identified</span>
    <span className="ft3">aggregate data with others for their own uses.</span> No
    personal information from children is transferred or sold.</p>

    <p className="p35 ft3">As we continue to develop CMWN, it is possible that we may
    sell parts or all of our company or merge or combine with another business, and
    personal information may be shared with the business as part of such a transaction,
    as permitted by law. In the event that information is shared in that way, notice will
    be provided to our school partners and posted on our Site.</p>

    <p className="p36 ft7">In compliance with applicable law, we reserve the right to
    share a child's personal information with third parties to the extent required
    by law and to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the security and integrity
    of our website, to take precautions against liability, to respond to judicial
    process, or to provide information to law enforcement agencies or for an
    investigation related to public safety.</p>

    <p className="p37 ft20">How do we notify and obtain consent from parents or guardians
    for the collection of information from their kids?</p>

    <p className="p38 ft3">Because CMWN contracts with schools to provide its services
    under the school's direction and control, we rely on schools to (1) provide the
    notice and disclosure information required under COPPA, including a copy of this
    Privacy Policy &amp; Conditions of Use; and (2) obtain Consent from the parents or
    guardians of all children under 13 before they are permitted to use the website.
    Schools must maintain the consent forms (or similar evidence of Consent) from parents
    or guardians and provide them to CMWN upon request.</p>

    <p className="p39 ft3">Because we take the safety and security of our users very
    seriously, we reserve the right to deny any person the use of the website if, in our
    sole discretion, we believe that the person, including any school official, teacher,
    parent or guardian or student, presents any risk to other users or to the person or
    to the website, or for any reason whatsoever. Even after registration CMWN reserves
    the right to continue to monitor all use and activities of persons using the website
    and reserves the right to terminate that person's access to the website at any
    time.</p>

    <p className="p40 ft1">What does CMWN do to keep personal information safe and
    secure?</p>

    <p className="p41 ft3">CMWN and your school work together to protect the online
    privacy and security of all of your school community members that use CMWN, including
    students, parents, guardians, teachers, and administrators. We maintain reasonable
    administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the security,
    confidentiality, and integrity of personal information on CMWN, which have been
    authorized by your school. For example, CMWN uses industry-standard technology called
    SSL (Secure Socket Layer) to encrypt information transmitted across the internet to
    and from CMWN. Unfortunately, no website or data transmission over the Internet can
    be guaranteed as completely secure.</p>

    <p className="p42 ft21">How can parent/guardians or students access, change or delete
    personally identifiable information about their kids?</p>

    <p className="p43 ft3">We want to be open with you about what information CMWN may
    collect from kids and give parents and guardians options. At any time parents or
    guardians can ask us to provide a description of the types or categories of
    information that may be collected from children. They can also request that CMWN stop
    collecting further personal information from their child and can request that any
    personal information we have collected be deleted from our records. Generally, we
    will keep children's information only for the time specified by the school or
    otherwise required by law.</p>

    <p className="p40 ft6">What are my rights as a California resident<span className=
    "ft22">?</span></p>

    <p className="p44 ft3"><span className="ft23">Direct Marketing</span>. California
    residents who provide personal information in obtaining products or services for
    personal, family, or household use are entitled to request and obtain from us once a
    calendar year information about the customer information we shared with third parties
    for their own direct marketing purposes, including the categories of information and
    the names and addresses of those businesses with which we have shared such
    information. CMWN does not share the personal information of California residents
    with third parties for direct marketing purposes. However, if you have further
    questions about our privacy practices and compliance with California law, please
    contact us as explained below.</p>

    <p className="p45 ft3"><span className="ft23">Right to Removal of Posted Information
    - California Minors</span>. If you are under 18 years of age, reside in
    California, and have a registered account with CMWN, you have the right to request
    removal of unwanted information that you publicly post on CMWN. To request removal of
    such information, you can contact your school or contact us directly as explained
    below. Upon receiving such a request, CMWN will make sure that the information is not
    publicly available on CMWN, but the information may not be completely or
    comprehensively removed from our systems and databases.</p>

    <p className="p46 ft6">How will we notify you if our Privacy Policy &amp; Conditions
    of Use changes?</p>

    <p className="p47 ft3">We may amend our Privacy Policy &amp; Conditions of Use and
    will post the revised and current version of our Privacy Policy on our website. In
    addition, we may provide additional notice to the school or parents/guardians by
    email or other means as appropriate and required by law. In order to allow us to
    communicate with parents/guardians and teachers, they should make sure they keep
    their information, including their email address, up-to-date. You can contact your
    school or us at any time to request changes like this.</p>

    <p className="p48 ft24">Who can you contact if you have additional questions or
    concerns about privacy and security on CMWN?</p>
