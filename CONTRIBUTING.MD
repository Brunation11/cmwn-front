# CMWN Javascript Style Guide

## Overview
As a general rule, all Javascript code being contributed to CMWN should follow the rules outlined in this document. For any rules not specified here, style rules should conform to the Standard Javascript Style. For arbitrary style choices (e.g. tabs vs spaces) we defer to PHP PSR1 for maximum overall consistency across all repositories whenever possible.
